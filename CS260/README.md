# CS260

Each file (or files) in `SortSearch/src/edu/wou/cs260` and `Spellchecker/edu/wou/cs260` corresponds to one of these PDF documents which has directions on how we were to complete these assignments.

In some cases, files (such as `DLList.java` and `BSTree.java`) are used together to create a functional program needed to complete an assignment.

The labs were done in Java using Eclipse IDE.
