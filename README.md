# WOU Homework and Labs

## Overview
This repository houses all of my computer science coursework for Western Oregon University.

## Repository Contents

### CS162
This course provided students with a foundation in software development, which includes advanced object-oriented programming concepts, GUI and event-driven programming, file I/O, recursion and further exploration of the Java libraries.

The labs were done in Java using BlueJ IDE, often in pairs.

### CS260 - Data Structures I
This course introduced students to the concept of abstract data types and the algorithms which manipulate them.

The labs were done in Java using Eclipse IDE.

### CS360 - Programming Languages
This course provided a comparative study of programming language paradigms and their application. Paradigms studied include imperative, functional, logic and object-oriented languages.

### CS361 - Data Structures II
This course is a continuation of CS260 (Data Stuctures I) that focuses on exploring and analyzing more advanced algorithms.

The labs were done in Java using Eclipse IDE.

### CS460 - Software Engineering I
This course introduced students to the fundamental principles and practices of software engineering.

### CS465 - Microservices Architecture
This course covered the basic concepts of microservices, including:
* Familiarization with the core concepts of microservices
* Learning about bounded contexts and the web APIs
* The monolith problem and how that lead to the microservices pattern
* Microservice domain models and data domains
* Implementing microservices using modern languages and frameworks
* The microservice development lifecycle
* How microservices scale (both organizationally and physically)
* Securing microservices

### A120 - Foundations of Digital Art and Design
This course introduced students to the use of personal computers in art and visual communications. Computer-imaging software, such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator and Adobe InDesign were used to create original art in a variety of final output formats.

Although this course was not part of my computer science curriculum, I thought I'd add it in to demonstrate my digital art skills.
