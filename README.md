### CS162
This course provided students with a foundation in software development, which includes advanced object-oriented programming concepts, GUI and event-driven programming, file I/O, recursion and further exploration of the Java libraries.

The labs were done in Java using BlueJ IDE, often in pairs.

### CS260 - Data Structures I
This course introduced students to the concept of abstract data types and the algorithms which manipulate them.

The labs were done in Java using Eclipse IDE.

### CS361 - Data Structures II
This course is a continuation of CS260 (Data Stuctures I) that focuses on exploring and analyzing more advanced algorithms.

The labs were done in Java using Eclipse IDE.

### CS460 - Software Engineering I
This course introduced students to the fundamental principles and practices of software engineering.
